<p class="p5"><b>Eligibility</b></p>
<p class="p4">You must be an individual who is at least 13 years old to use our Software (or such greater age required in your country for you to be authorized to use our Software without parental approval). In addition to being of the minimum required age to use our Software under applicable law, if you are not old enough to have the authority to agree to these Terms in your country, your parent or guardian must agree to the Terms on your behalf.</p>
<p class="p6"><b>Privacy</b></p>

<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li7">We grant you a personal, limited, fully revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the executable code of the Software for your own personal, non-commercial purposes solely as installed on your mobile devices. You may only use the Software as expressly authorized in these Terms.</li>
  <li class="li7">Unless expressly permitted by law, you may not copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Software. You may not remove, obscure, or alter any copyright notice or other proprietary rights notices affixed to or contained within the Software. You may not separate the component programs of the Software for use on different computers or sublicense, lease, rent, loan, or distribute the Software to any third party. You may not permit, direct or authorize any third party to take any action with respect to the Software which is inconsistent with the Terms.</li>
  <li class="li7">You acknowledge and agree that the Software contains our valuable intellectual property, including its content, sequence, structure, organization, source code, and applicable documentation.</li>
  <li class="li7">The Software is licensed and not sold to you, and no title or ownership to such Software or the intellectual property rights embodied therein is granted to you. The Software is our exclusive property, and all rights in and to the Software not expressly granted to you in the Terms are reserved. You acknowledge and agree that any actual or threatened breach of these Terms will constitute immediate, irreparable harm to us for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy for any such breach or violation.</li>
  <li class="li7">The Software contains software components provided by third parties. Third-party software, particularly open-source software, may be subject to separate license terms, available at: <span class="s1">(ссылка на документ со сторонними библиотеками)</span>.

  <li class="li7">Your license to use the Software terminates if you breach these Terms. The Terms will commence upon downloading the Software and continue perpetually unless terminated earlier. These Terms will immediately terminate upon your breach of any of the terms or conditions herein. Upon the termination, you will stop using and promptly uninstall the Software, and, upon request from us, certify in writing that such destruction has occurred. These remedies are cumulative and in addition to any other remedies available.</li>
  <li class="li7">THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," AND WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES CONCERNING THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR USE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE USE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE OR THE SOFTWARE DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY VIRUSES. THIS WARRANTY DISCLAIMER IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE DEAL BETWEEN YOU AND US. WE WOULD NOT PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE ABSENT SUCH A DISCLAIMER. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE OR WITH ANY OF THESE TERMS, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SOFTWARE.</li>

IN NO EVENT WILL OUR CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID TO US IN RESPECT OF THE SOFTWARE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM OR, IF NO FEES WERE PAID, THEN ONE HUNDRED GREAT BRITISH POUNDS. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE FOREGOING EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE DEAL BETWEEN YOU AND US. WE WOULD NOT PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE TO YOU ABSENT SUCH LIMITATION.</li>
